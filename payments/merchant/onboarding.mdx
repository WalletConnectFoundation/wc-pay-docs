The WalletConnect Pay Merchant Dashboard is a tool that allows merchants to create a WalletConnect Pay account, monitor transactions, perform KYB, and facilitate off-ramps.

## How to get started

To get started as a Merchant, you need to create a WalletConnect Pay account. You can do this by signing up on the [Merchant Dashboard](). 

After creating an account, you will be able to access the Merchant Dashboard. **You will need to provide your KYB information to the PSP you are working with.** This is a mandatory step for any merchant to ensure compliance with regulations.
