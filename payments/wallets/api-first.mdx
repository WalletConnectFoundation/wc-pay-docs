If you’re integrating WalletConnect Pay into a wallet **without using the Wallet Pay SDK**, you can use an API-first approach via the **Gateway API**.

This flow is centered around **three Gateway calls**:

- **Get payment options**: list options the user can complete with their wallet/accounts
- **Fetch an action**: resolve “build” actions into wallet RPC actions when needed
- **Confirm a payment**: submit the selected option and the executed action results

## Prerequisites

- **API key**: request access from WalletConnect
  - You can do this by filling out [**this form**](https://share.hsforms.com/19Dpp4ayYR9uriB3xNAh0JAnxw6s) and getting in touch with our team.
- **Wallet identity headers** (required on each request):
  - `Sdk-Name`
  - `Sdk-Version`
  - `Sdk-Platform`

## High-level flow

### 1) Get payment options

Call **Get payment options** for the given `paymentId`, passing a list of accounts (CAIP-10 / chain namespace format as provided by your wallet).

- Use this response to render:
  - payment details (optionally, if `includePaymentInfo=true`)
  - available `options[]` the user can pick from
  - required `actions[]` for the chosen option

### 2) Fetch an action (only if required)

If an option contains an action of type **`build`**, call **Fetch an action** with that `optionId` and the `data` payload to resolve it into one or more executable actions (typically `walletRpc`).

### 3) Confirm a payment

After your wallet executes the required `walletRpc` actions (sign/submit), call **Confirm a payment** with:

- the selected `optionId`
- `results[]`: the output from each executed action (in the same spirit/order you performed them)
- optional `collectedData` if the options response requested additional user info
