If you’re integrating WalletConnect Pay into a wallet **without using the Wallet Pay SDK**, you can use an API-first approach via the **Gateway API**.

This flow is centered around **three Gateway calls**:

- **Get payment options**: list options the user can complete with their wallet/accounts
- **Fetch an action**: resolve “build” actions into wallet RPC actions when needed
- **Confirm a payment**: submit the selected option and the executed action results

## Prerequisites

- **API key**: request access from WalletConnect
  - You can do this by filling out [**this form**](https://share.hsforms.com/19Dpp4ayYR9uriB3xNAh0JAnxw6s) and getting in touch with our team.
- **Wallet identity headers** (required on each request):
  - `Sdk-Name`
  - `Sdk-Version`
  - `Sdk-Platform`

## Payment flow

The payment flow mirrors the SDK flow, but you call the Gateway API directly:

**Get Options → (Fetch Actions) → Execute Wallet RPC → (Collect Data) → Confirm Payment**

    User->>Wallet: Scan QR / Open payment link
    Wallet->>Gateway: POST /v1/gateway/payment/{id}/options (accounts)
    Gateway-->>Wallet: options[] (+ optional info/collectData)
    Wallet->>User: Display payment options

    User->>Wallet: Select payment option

    alt Option includes a build action
        Wallet->>Gateway: POST /v1/gateway/payment/{id}/fetch (optionId, data)
        Gateway-->>Wallet: actions[] (walletRpc)
    end

    Wallet->>User: Request signature(s) / transaction(s)
    User->>Wallet: Approve
    Wallet->>Chain: Execute wallet RPC actions (in order)
    Chain-->>Wallet: Results (e.g., signature(s) / tx hash(es))

    alt Data collection required
        Wallet->>User: Request additional info
        User->>Wallet: Provide data
    end

    Wallet->>Gateway: POST /v1/gateway/payment/{id}/confirm (optionId, results, collectedData?)
    Gateway-->>Wallet: status + isFinal (+ pollInMs)
    Wallet->>User: Show result / status
```

## Understanding `actions`

Payment options can include an `actions[]` array. Each action tells your wallet what needs to happen next.

- **`walletRpc` actions**
  - The Gateway gives you a wallet RPC payload (`chain_id`, `method`, `params`)
  - Your wallet should execute it (sign / send), then record the output to submit in `results[]`

- **`build` actions**
  - The action is not directly executable by the wallet
  - Call **Fetch an action** to convert the `build` payload into one or more **`walletRpc`** actions

<Warning>
Maintain action ordering. The `results[]` you submit in **Confirm a payment** must correspond to the actions you executed, in order.
</Warning>

## High-level steps

### 1) Get payment options

Call **Get payment options** for the given `paymentId`, passing a list of accounts (CAIP-10 / chain namespace format as provided by your wallet).

- Use this response to render:
  - payment details (optionally, if `includePaymentInfo=true`)
  - available `options[]` the user can pick from
  - required `actions[]` for the chosen option

### 2) Fetch an action (only if required)

If an option contains an action of type **`build`**, call **Fetch an action** with that `optionId` and the `data` payload to resolve it into one or more executable actions (typically `walletRpc`).

### 3) Confirm a payment

After your wallet executes the required `walletRpc` actions (sign/submit), call **Confirm a payment** with:

- the selected `optionId`
- `results[]`: the output from each executed action (in the same spirit/order you performed them)
- optional `collectedData` if the options response requested additional user info

<Note>
If `isFinal` is `false`, the response may include `pollInMs`. Use it to decide when to check again (see the API Reference for status/polling behavior).
</Note>
