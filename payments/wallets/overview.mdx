Wallets can make their app fully compatible with WalletConnect Pay to deliver a truly native payment experience. Users pay with crypto in real world scenarios with minimal friction while the wallet retains custody and full control over the user experience.

WalletConnect provides two integration approaches for enabling WalletConnect Pay in your wallet:

## Integration Options

### Integrate using the Wallet SDK (Recommended)

If your wallet already uses the WalletConnect Wallet SDK (WalletKit), WalletConnect Pay is automatically available when you initialize WalletKit. This is the recommended approach as it provides a unified API and automatic configuration.

### Standalone Integration

For wallets that don't currently use the WalletConnect Wallet SDK, you can integrate the standalone Pay SDK directly. This approach requires configuring the SDK with your WalletConnect Project ID.

### API-First Integration

For wallets that prefer direct API integration without using an SDK, you can use the Gateway API directly.

## Getting Started

To get started with WalletConnect Pay integration:

1. **Get a Project ID**: Create a project at the [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) to obtain your Project ID.

2. **Choose your integration approach**: Select either the WalletKit integration (if you already use WalletKit) or the standalone Pay SDK integration.

3. **Follow the platform-specific guide**: Use the documentation for your platform to implement the payment flow.

## Payment Flow Overview

Regardless of which integration approach you choose, the payment flow follows the same pattern:

1. **Detect Payment Link**: Identify when a user scans or opens a WalletConnect Pay link
2. **Get Payment Options**: Fetch available payment options based on user's accounts
3. **Get Required Actions**: Retrieve the signing actions for the selected payment option
4. **Sign Actions**: Sign the required permits/transactions using your wallet's signing infrastructure
5. **Collect User Data** (if required): Gather any additional user information for compliance
6. **Confirm Payment**: Submit signatures and complete the payment
