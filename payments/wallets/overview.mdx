Wallets will be able make their wallet fully compatible with WalletConnect Pay to provide a native payment experience for their users. This means your users will experience less friction when paying with crypto in real-world context, retaining custody and control of the UX.

In order to facilitate this, WalletConnect will provide an SDK that will allow wallets to achieve this, called the **Wallet Pay SDK**.
