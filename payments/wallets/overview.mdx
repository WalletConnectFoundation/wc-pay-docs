Wallets can make their app fully compatible with WalletConnect Pay to deliver a truly native payment experience. Users pay with crypto in real world scenarios with minimal friction while the wallet retains custody and full control over the user experience.

In order to facilitate this, WalletConnect provides an SDK that allows wallets to achieve this, called the **Wallet Pay SDK**.

<Note>
**WalletConnect Pay will soon be bundled into the existing [Wallet SDK](https://docs.walletconnect.network/wallet-sdk/overview)**. If your wallet already uses the WalletConnect SDK, it is recommended to wait for the upcoming release and upgrade your SDK to enable WalletConnect Pay, rather than integrating the standalone WalletConnect Pay SDK below.
</Note>

For wallets that don't currently use the WalletConnect SDK, you can proceed with the standalone Pay SDK integration below or use the [API-first approach](/payments/wallets/api-first).

## Get Started

As a wallet provider, you would first need to **obtain an API key from WalletConnect**. You can do this by filling out [**this form**](https://share.hsforms.com/19Dpp4ayYR9uriB3xNAh0JAnxw6s) and getting in touch with our team.

**Once you have obtained an API key**, you can integrate the Wallet Pay SDK into your wallet. The SDK is available for Kotlin, Swift, and React Native.
