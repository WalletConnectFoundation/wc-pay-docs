Wallets can make their app fully compatible with WalletConnect Pay to deliver a truly native payment experience. Users pay with crypto in real world scenarios with minimal friction while the wallet retains custody and full control over the user experience.

WalletConnect provides two integration approaches for enabling WalletConnect Pay in your wallet:

## Integration Options

### Integrate using the Wallet SDK (Recommended)

If your wallet already uses the WalletConnect Wallet SDK (WalletKit), WalletConnect Pay is automatically available when you initialize WalletKit. This is the recommended approach as it provides a unified API and automatic configuration.

### Standalone Integration

For wallets that don't currently use the WalletConnect Wallet SDK, you can integrate the standalone Pay SDK directly. This approach requires configuring the SDK with your WalletConnect Project ID.

### API-First Integration

For wallets that prefer direct API integration without using an SDK, you can use the Gateway API directly.

## Getting Started

To get started with WalletConnect Pay integration:

1. **Get a Project ID**: Create a project at the [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://dashboard.walletconnect.com) to obtain your Project ID.

2. **Choose your integration approach**: Select either the WalletKit integration (if you already use WalletKit) or the standalone Pay SDK integration.

3. **Follow the platform-specific guide**: Use the documentation for your platform to implement the payment flow.

## Payment Flow Overview

Regardless of which integration approach you choose, the payment flow follows the same pattern:

1. **Detect Payment Link**: Identify when a user scans or opens a WalletConnect Pay link
2. **Get Payment Options**: Fetch available payment options based on user's accounts
3. **Get Required Actions**: Retrieve the signing actions for the selected payment option
4. **Sign Actions**: Sign the required permits/transactions using your wallet's signing infrastructure
5. **Collect User Data** (if required): Gather any additional user information for compliance
6. **Confirm Payment**: Submit signatures and complete the payment

## Supported Networks

WalletConnect Pay currently supports USDC payments on the following networks:

| Network | Chain ID |
|---------|----------|
| Ethereum | 1 |

## User Information FAQs

<Accordion title="Does the user need to enter their information for every transaction?">
No. The process is optimised so users don't have to re-enter information for each transaction. Once collected, the information will be reused.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my wallet already has the required data?">
Wallets that already have verified user PII (e.g. a neobank, a card issuing wallet) can pass this information directly. The user will see just the payment flow without additional data collection steps.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does this work technically?">
When processing a payment:
1. Check if `response.collectData` is present
2. If present and you don't already have the required user information, collect it from the user
3. If present and you already have the required user information, skip collection and submit the data directly with the signatures
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is user information required?">
WalletConnect Pay complies with Travel Rule regulations to ensure the payment flow is scalable and future-proof across all regions. This requires capturing some user information like name and date of birth.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the requirements before submitting user information?">
Whether you are collecting the information or not, before submitting user information to WalletConnect, you must ensure the user has accepted:
- [WalletConnect Terms and Conditions](https://walletconnect.com/terms)
- [WalletConnect Privacy Policy](https://walletconnect.com/privacy)
</Accordion>
