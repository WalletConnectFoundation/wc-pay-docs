WalletConnect Pay lets you pay with crypto from any wallet, any asset, and on any network. 

## What you’ll see at checkout

When a store supports WalletConnect Pay, you’ll typically see a **“Pay with Crypto”** option and one of the following:

- **A WalletConnect QR code** shown on the POS device. You can use any wallet that supports WalletConnect Pay to scan the QR code directly from within the wallet and make the payment.
- **A QR code you can scan with your phone camera**, which opens a payment page on your mobile browser where you can connect your wallet with WalletConnect and make the payment.

## How paying works

1. Scan the QR code with your wallet (or open the payment page and connect your wallet).
2. Your wallet shows the **payment intent** (what you’re paying, how much, and where it’s going).
3. Choose the **token** and **network** you want to use (for example, USDC on Ethereum).
4. Approve the payment in your wallet.
5. Wait for the transaction result and confirmation.

## What to double-check before you approve

- **Amount and currency**: make sure it matches what you expect.
- **Network and fees**: fees and confirmation times depend on the network you choose.
- **Where you’re sending funds**: only approve if the payment details look right.

## Your security

WalletConnect Pay never requires your seed phrase. If any page or app asks for it, don’t proceed.
