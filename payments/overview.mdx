Digital payments across blockchains remain inconsistent. Payments are fragmented by geography and <Tooltip headline="Rail" tip="The term for the payment network that is used to process payments.">Rail</Tooltip>. For example, a few countries in Latin America run on PIX and Mercado Pago, Europe on SEPA and cards, Southeast Asia on QR wallets like GrabPay and GCash, China on Alipay and WeChat Pay, India on UPI. 

Each region invented its own system, none of them interoperate, and merchants and PSPs are forced to support whatever their local stack dictates. Users adapt to the rail in front of them rather than the method they prefer.

In the world of Crypto payments, each wallet, merchant, and provider implements its own integration model. This fragmentation slows innovation and limits interoperability. 

To address this, WalletConnect introduces the **WalletConnect Pay**. 

**WalletConnect Pay** provides a complete end-to-end crypto payment solution that fits directly into an existing Payment Service Provider (PSP) stack, allowing crypto payments to be offered without changing how payments operate today. 

It also aligns with common **payment compliance requirements**, such as required customer and transaction information capture and screening steps, so providers can keep the same operational and compliance controls they rely on today.

## Who is WalletConnect Pay for?

There are a couple of primary actors that can benefit from WalletConnect Pay:

- **Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Acquirers** - PSPs and Acquirers can use the POS (Point of Sale) SDK to integrate WalletConnect Pay into their existing payment stack. This allows them to offer their merchants and customers an option to accept crypto payments without changing how payments operate today.
- **Merchants** - PSPs and Acquirers can offer their merchants an option to accept crypto payments without changing how payments operate today.
- **Wallets** - Wallets can work closely with WalletConnect to provide a seamless payment experience for their users by integrating the WalletConnect Pay SDK into their wallet.

## What would WalletConnect Pay look like in action?

WalletConnect Pay would live inside the POS device that a merchant uses to accept day-to-day payments. The flow would be as follows:

 ></video>

1. The merchant selects "Pay with Crypto" on the POS device.
2. The POS device generates a WalletConnect QR with the payment intent.
3. The customer scans the QR with their wallet:
   - The wallet displays the payment intent.
   - The customer picks the token and network of their choice (e.g., USDC on Ethereum) and approves the payment.
   - The wallet builds the transaction and sends it to the network.

4. Or alternatively, the customer scans the QR code with their QR scanner:
    - This takes the customer to a payment gateway URL that is pre-filled with the payment intent.
    - The customer can connect their wallet (using WalletConnect).
    - The wallet displays the payment intent.
    - The customer picks the token and network of their choice (e.g., USDC on Ethereum) and approves the payment.
    - The wallet builds the transaction and sends it to the network.
5. The POS device receives the transaction result and displays it to the customer.
6. The merchant then receives fiat or crypto settlement from the PSP.
