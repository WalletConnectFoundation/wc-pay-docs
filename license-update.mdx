title: "License Update"
---

WalletConnect SDKs are now offered under the [WalletConnect Community License](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/blob/v2.0/LICENSE.md).

The Community License keeps the same open access for developers while adding clear terms that help keep the WalletConnect experience reliable, sustainable, and consistent for developers and end users alike.

Developers may still integrate, experiment, and ship freely. The Community License simply adds clear conditions (like attribution and reasonable infrastructure usage thresholds) to protect service quality and maintain a great developer experience across the WalletConnect ecosystem.

For larger-scale commercial developers, there's a clear path to supplemental licenses for expanded use.

These updates make it easier for everyone to build confidently on stable infrastructure.

See the individual SDKs' READMEs and LICENSEs (e.g., [walletconnect-monorepo](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo)) for more details.
