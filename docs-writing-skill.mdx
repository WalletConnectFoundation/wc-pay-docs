title: "WalletConnect Pay Documentation Writing Skill"
---

This skill guide defines how to write documentation for WalletConnect products using Mintlify. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency across all documentation.

---

## Voice and Tone

### Brand Attribution
- **Always use "WalletConnect"** as the subject when describing capabilities, offerings, or actions.
- **Never use** first-person pronouns like "we", "our", "us", or "my team" when referring to WalletConnect.

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| We provide this SDK | WalletConnect provides this SDK |
| Our team built this feature | WalletConnect built this feature |
| The SDK provided by us | The SDK provided by WalletConnect |
| We recommend using... | WalletConnect recommends using... |

### Writing Style
- **Be concise and direct.** Get to the point without unnecessary preamble.
- **Avoid vague language.** Replace words like "stuff", "things", "various", "etc." with specific terms.
- **Use active voice** wherever possible.
- **Write for a technical audience** but remain accessible.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|---------|-----------|
| The SDK does various things | The SDK handles payment initialization, option selection, and confirmation |
| Set up some configuration stuff | Configure the API key, project ID, and package name |
| There are several options available | Three payment options are available: Ethereum, Base, and Polygon |

## Document Structure

### Page Frontmatter (Required)
Every `.mdx` file must begin with frontmatter for SEO and navigation. **Do not use H1 (`#`) for the page title**, it is automatically generated from the frontmatter.

```mdx
---
title: "WalletConnect Pay"
description: "Overview of WalletConnect Pay, a universal protocol that enables wallets and payment applications to exchange blockchain-based payment requests."
sidebarTitle: "Introduction"
---
```

#### Frontmatter Fields
| Field | Required | Guidelines |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `title` | Yes | The full page title. Displayed at the top of the page and used for SEO. |
| `description` | Yes | A short, concise summary (1-2 sentences). Used for SEO meta description. |
| `sidebarTitle` | Recommended | A simple, use-case-driven label for the sidebar. **Avoid technical jargon.** |

**sidebarTitle examples:**

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| Kotlin SDK Implementation Guide | Kotlin |
| WalletConnect Pay API Reference v2.0 | API Reference |
| EIP-155 Chain Configuration | Supported Networks |

### Heading Hierarchy
- **Never use H1 (`#`)** in the body. The title comes from frontmatter.
- **H2 (`##`)**: Major sections.
- **H3 (`###`)**: Subsections within H2 sections.
- **H4 (`####`)**: Subsections within H3 sections (use sparingly).
- **Never use bold text as a substitute for headings.**

## Mintlify Components

### Callouts

Use callouts to style and emphasize important content. Available types:

```mdx
<Note>This adds a note in the content</Note>
```

```mdx
<Warning>This raises a warning to watch out for</Warning>
```

```mdx
<Info>This draws attention to important information</Info>
```

```mdx
<Tip>This suggests a helpful tip</Tip>
```

```mdx
<Check>This brings us a checked status</Check>
```

```mdx
<Danger>This is a danger callout</Danger>
```

You can also create custom callouts with icons:

```mdx
<Callout icon="key" color="#FFC107" iconType="regular">This is a custom callout</Callout>
```

**When to use each:**
| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `<Note>` | General supplementary information |
| `<Warning>` | Breaking changes, deprecations, things to watch out for |
| `<Info>` | Important context or clarification |
| `<Tip>` | Best practices, recommendations |
| `<Check>` | Success states, completed steps |
| `<Danger>` | Critical warnings, potential data loss, security concerns |

### Steps

Use `<Steps>` to display a series of sequential actions or events. **Recommended for high-level/conceptual pages.** Can also be used in technical docs when relevant.

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the second step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the third step.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

**Step properties:**
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Required. The title shown next to the step indicator. |
| `icon` | string | Optional. Font Awesome or Lucide icon name. |
| `stepNumber` | number | Optional. Override the step number. |

### Cards and Columns (CTAs)

Use `<Columns>` to group multiple `<Card>` components in a grid. **Prefer `cols={2}` for better appearance.**

```mdx
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get started">
    Set up your project with our quickstart guide.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API reference">
    Explore endpoints, parameters, and examples for your API.
  </Card>
</Columns>
```

**Columns properties:**
| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cols` | number | 2 | Number of columns per row. Accepts values from 1 to 4. |

### Code Groups

Use `<CodeGroup>` to display multiple code blocks in a tabbed interface. **Use when documenting the same logic/feature across different languages, platforms, or blockchain networks.**

Each code block must include a title, which becomes the tab label. The code blocks must be placed **within** the `<CodeGroup>` opening and closing tags.

````mdx
<CodeGroup>
```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
````

You can also use a dropdown menu instead of tabs with the `dropdown` prop:

````mdx
<CodeGroup dropdown>
```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```
</CodeGroup>
````

### Accordions (FAQs)

Use `<Accordion>` for expandable/collapsible content. **Always use `<AccordionGroup>` to group related accordions together for FAQ sections.**

**Single Accordion:**

```mdx
<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here, including other components.
</Accordion>
```

**Accordion Group (for FAQs):**

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What networks does WalletConnect Pay support?">
    WalletConnect Pay currently supports Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I obtain an API key?">
    Fill out the contact form and the WalletConnect team will provide your API credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
    Keep related content organized into groups.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

**Accordion properties:**
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Required. Title in the Accordion preview. |
| `description` | string | Optional. Detail below the title in the Accordion preview. |
| `defaultOpen` | boolean | Optional. Whether the Accordion is open by default (default: false). |
| `icon` | string | Optional. Font Awesome or Lucide icon name. |

### Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid to build flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and other diagrams using text and code. **Include Mermaid diagrams in technical docs when explaining multi-step flows, architecture, or SDK workflows.**

To create a Mermaid diagram, write your diagram definition inside a Mermaid code block:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    outside --> subgraph1
    outside ---> top2
```

**When to use diagrams:**
- Payment flows and transaction lifecycles
- SDK initialization and configuration flows
- Architecture overviews
- Multi-step API interactions

For a complete list of supported diagram types and syntax, see the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

## Code Guidelines

### Code Blocks
- **Always specify the language** for syntax highlighting.
- **Include a title** for the code block (becomes the filename display).
- **Keep code focused**. Show only relevant code.
- **Add comments** to explain non-obvious parts.
- **Use realistic placeholder values** (`"your-api-key"`, not `"abc123"`).

```kotlin Installation
dependencies {
    implementation("com.walletconnect:pay:1.0.0")
}
```

### Tables
Use tables for:
- Configuration parameters (Parameter | Type | Required | Description)
- Error codes and descriptions
- Supported networks/chains
- API method references
