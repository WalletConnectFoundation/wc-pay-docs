## WebView-Based Data Collection

When a payment requires user information (e.g., for Travel Rule compliance), the SDK returns a `collectDataAction` with a `url` field pointing to a WalletConnect-hosted form page.

Instead of building native forms, wallets display this URL in a WebView. The hosted form handles rendering, validation, and Terms & Conditions acceptance. When the user completes the form, the WebView communicates back to the wallet via JavaScript bridge messages.

### How It Works

1. Check if `collectDataAction.url` is present in the payment options response
2. Open the URL in a WebView within your wallet
3. Optionally append a `?prefill=<base64-json>` query parameter with known user data (e.g., name, date of birth)
4. Listen for JS bridge messages: `IC_COMPLETE` (success) or `IC_ERROR` (failure)
5. On `IC_COMPLETE`, proceed to `confirmPayment()` **without** passing `collectedData` — the WebView submits data directly to the backend

<Info>
The `collectDataAction` also includes a `schema` field — a JSON schema string describing the required fields. Wallets that want to parse field requirements themselves (e.g., for prefilling data or building custom native forms as an advanced fallback) can use this schema.

<Warning>
When using the WebView approach, do **not** pass `collectedData` to `confirmPayment()`. The WebView handles data submission directly.
