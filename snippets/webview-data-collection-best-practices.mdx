### WebView Data Collection Best Practices

- **Display prominently**: Show the WebView full-screen or as a prominent modal so users can interact with the form easily
- **Loading indicator**: Show a loading indicator while the WebView page loads
- **Handle errors**: Listen for `IC_ERROR` messages and display a user-facing error message with an option to retry
- **External links**: Open Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy links in the system browser rather than navigating within the WebView
- **Domain restriction**: Only allow navigation to WalletConnect pay domains and HTTPS URLs
- **Back navigation**: Handle back/dismiss gracefully — confirm cancellation with the user before closing the WebView mid-flow
- **Keyboard behavior**: Test that the soft keyboard appears and behaves correctly when users tap on form inputs within the WebView
